# Linear-Regression-Car-Price-Prediction
In this project, I performed a simple linear regression analysis on a car price dataset to explore which features influence car prices and to build a prediction model. The analysis also focuses on checking the assumptions of linear regression and applying data transformations and pipelines to improve model performance.
