# Linear-Regression-Car-Price-Prediction
In this project, I performed a simple linear regression analysis on a car price dataset to explore which features influence car prices and to build a prediction model. The analysis also focuses on checking the assumptions of linear regression and applying data transformations and pipelines to improve model performance.
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

After completing this project, I was able to:

âœ… Select significant features based on visual analysis

âœ… Check the assumptions for a Linear Regression model

âœ… Apply the Linear Regression model and make predictions

âœ… Use pipelines to transform and preprocess the data efficiently

ðŸ“Š About the Dataset

The dataset is hosted on IBM Cloud Object Storage and contains detailed information about various cars, including:

Manufacturer details

Year of launch

Technical specifications

Sale prices

Each row in the dataset represents a car, and the goal is to predict the sale price using these features.

âš¡ Technologies Used

Python 3

NumPy â€“ For numerical computations

Pandas â€“ For data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ For data visualization

Scikit-learn â€“ For building and evaluating the regression model
